## What Lab 3 Is

Lab 3 is entirely dedicated to building your Design Review. This is the first major capstone checkpoint and is worth **10 points**.

You already have the raw material from Labs 1 and 2 — your individual HW1 work, your team's six-section proposal draft, your scaffold, and your working vision call. Lab 3 takes that material and lifts it into a submission-ready Design Review by filling the gaps: measurable success criteria, a real architecture diagram with data flows, safety threats, fallback UX design, and data governance. You also sign and commit your team contract today.

The entire two hours is team work. There are no individual technical exercises in Lab 3 — those move to Lab 4 where you cover image generation and audio together.

**Design Review due: Thursday 2 April 2026 at 23:59 Georgia Time.**
Submission is your team repo (see required tree below) plus the Google Form link shared in lab and on Teams. There is no presentation.

## Status Check Before You Start

Resolve anything missing in the first 10 minutes. Raise your hand immediately — do not skip ahead.

### From Lab 1 (individual — in your personal fork of the course repo)
- [ ] `hw1/` submitted — script calling two Gemini models, README with cost table and reflection, `.env.example`
- [ ] `templates/reflection-template.md` completed

### From Lab 2 (team — in your team project repo)
- [ ] Team project repo exists under `github.com/ZA-KIU-Classroom/AI-POWERED-SOFTWARE-DEV-SP26`
- [ ] All team members have push access
- [ ] `frontend/` scaffold will be committed at a later date
- [ ] `backend/` folder exists with at least a placeholder
- [ ] Working vision call committed (image input + AI response)
- [ ] Six-section proposal draft completed — all 6 sections at least started
- [ ] Team roles assigned in writing
- [ ] OpenRouter API key confirmed working

## Required Team Repo Tree at Submission

This is the structure you began setting up in Lab 2. Today you are adding `TEAM-CONTRACT.md` and filling in `docs/design-review/`. The grader navigates this tree directly.

```
[your-project-name]/
├── README.md                          ← Project overview — update this today
├── TEAM-CONTRACT.md                   ← New today — signed by all members
├── .gitignore                         ← Covers .env, node_modules, __pycache__, venv/
├── .env.example                       ← Variable names with placeholder values, no real keys
├── AGENTS.md                          ← Optional but encouraged
│
├── frontend/                          ← To be added
│   └── [scaffold files]
│
├── backend/                           ← Or api/, server/
│   └── [backend files]
│
├── docs/
│   └── design-review/                 ← Create this folder today
│       ├── DESIGN-REVIEW.md           ← Main submission document, no [fill in] remaining
│       └── architecture-diagram.png   ← Committed diagram — hand-drawn photo is fine
│
└── tests/                             ← Empty for now
```

**Graders will check:**
- `TEAM-CONTRACT.md` in repo root with all member names typed in Signatures
- `docs/design-review/DESIGN-REVIEW.md` has no `[fill in]` remaining
- `docs/design-review/architecture-diagram.png` exists and is readable
- `.env` is NOT committed — confirm your `.gitignore` covers it
- `frontend/` scaffold from Lab 2 is present
